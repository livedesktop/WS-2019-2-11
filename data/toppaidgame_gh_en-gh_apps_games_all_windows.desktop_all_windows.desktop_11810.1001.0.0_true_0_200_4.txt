Harry at the End of the World is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, in the vain of Samorost and Machinarium, where solving puzzles comes with a sense of discovery and accomplishment. This gameplay style, merged with unique artstyle inspired by 15th century engravings, creates the perfect backdrop for a story about heartbreak, redemption and, quite literally, the end of the world.\r\n\r\nIn Apocalipsis you play as Harry, for whom the loss of his beloved was the end of his world. Now he has to venture out into the strange, unwelcoming lands to get her back. On his journey he will meet fantastical creatures, straight from the minds of artists from the 15th century Europe, and ultimately conquer his own, personal demons. \r\nFeaturing the narration by Nergal, leader of the band Behemoth, with the added atmospheric new rendition of Behemoth's music, it will be a journey to remember.\r\n\r\nApocalipsis shares with the Middle Ages its artstyle and the game’s world itself is inspired by Book of Revelation and steeped in medieval philosophy and beliefs, with the story taking cues from Dante Alighieri’s “Divine Comedy”.\r\nEvery location and character in Apocalipsis was inspired by classical woodcuts by 15th and 16th century artists such as Hans Holbein, Michael Wolgemut, and Albrecht Dürer. This pairing of medieval art and philosophy with video games creates something unique, like you’ve never seen before.\r\n\r\nCome, let us take you on a journey you will not forget!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PCTTQSPSVLR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Surface: Virtual Detective","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43373.14162801897250380.2642d647-4b55-456b-9502-11e3477bd1f6.f78f7d9f-b790-473f-a4d9-6fccefb3eb0c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44554.14162801897250380.2642d647-4b55-456b-9502-11e3477bd1f6.cd5224cc-6c16-409f-8ad6-50cad8e12444","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53270.14162801897250380.4a9d8da9-fcd4-429d-9d55-53e5505970d9.7e0e2360-39e6-4911-a1e6-510b2e268f71","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48061.14162801897250380.4a9d8da9-fcd4-429d-9d55-53e5505970d9.b0cc9b59-bc2f-40ef-ae88-62b381dcb831","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.SurfaceVirtualDetective_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["fad953b7-ec63-68ab-8330-bfa3f5e182a0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Elephant Games, the studio that created Mystery Trackers and Haunted Hotel proudly present their latest hidden-object puzzle adventure in the innovative Surface series!\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Detective Agency is now hiring!

It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered squares. Several \"ladders\" and \"snakes\" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares.\r\n\r\nThis game can be player by minimum 2 and maximum 4 players. The names of players should be mention in first screen.\r\n\r\n1) The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the end by moving across the board from square one to the final square. \r\nFollow the numbers on the board to see how to move forward. Here, we have implemented ‘roll the dice’ feature by pressing the colour button. For example, if you got a five and you were on space number 11, then you would move your game piece to space number 16.\r\n2) Press the highlighted button to get dice value and move piece - Take your turn, press the highlighted button and read the number that you got. Here we have shown, highlighted button for the next move piece. Pick up your game piece and move forward that number of spaces. \r\n3) The ladders on the game board allow you to move upwards and get ahead faster. If you land exactly on a square that shows an image of the bottom of a ladder, then you may move your game piece all the way up to the square at the top of the ladder.\r\n4) If you land exactly at the top of a snake or chute, slide your game piece all the way to the square at the bottom of the snake or chute.\r\n5) As per game rule, if you got a six, then you get an extra turn. First, roll the die again, if we get another six, roll the dice again. If you keep rolling sixes, you can keep moving. But if we get 3 sixes, then it will be treated as zero. Here we have implemented this internally and we need not click the button again, if we get a six. You will get the move value in dice image.\r\n6) Land exactly on the last square to win. The first person to reach the highest square (100) on the board wins. You can only win by getting the exact number needed to land on the last square. Let’s say you are at 98, and we get 3 or more then the piece will bounce back to 98.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

It is based on the popular Austrian Tarock - also known as \"Königsrufen (King Calling)\".\r\n\r\nThe complete deck contains 54 cards, 32 color suit cards and 22 tarock cards. The color suits are: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. The tarock cards are labeled by roman numerals from I, II, III, ... to XXII and function in the game as a permanent suit of trumps. The playing order is counter-clockwise. The game starts with an auction process: The player with the highest bidding becomes the game declarer. There are positive games and negative games: In a positive game, the declarer must achieve a minimum number of points to win. In a negative game, the declarer must achieve the announced number of tricks (0 to 2) exactly. Basically, in all games, players have to follow suit. In negative games additionally, each player must overtrump if possible. Because there are special games for the forehand player, it never happens that all players pass and no game comes out. See Game Rules for the details.\r\n\r\nThe current version provides five playing modes:\r\n•Offline mode\r\n In this mode, the user controls at least one player. All other players will be controlled by the simulator \"Tarobot\". The simulator by the way sees only those cards the human player would also see. But you, too, can let the \"Tarobot\" support you in playing. If you select the appropriate setting, it marks the action on the user interface that it would perform in your place.\r\n•Learning mode\r\n In the learning mode you can question any action that the \"Tarobot\" simulator proposes for you. He will then tell you the reasons why he thinks the action makes sense. Of course, the Tarobot is not a person who takes into account the psychology of other players. He is a pure numeric, who expresses everything in numbers to evaluate them with his algorithms. But he knows all the rules and can give the beginner important hints when practicing the game.\r\n•Quiz mode\r\n This mode is a variant of the offline mode. In addition to the fun of playing, you can train your memory and thus your playing skills improve. Randomly selected questions about the current card playing state are presented to you during the game. After you have selected the supposedly correct answer, the solution will be presented to you immediately. Depending on the question you will get different number of points for the correct or also for an almost correct solution. In the quiz statistics you can read the development of your success in a calendar. If you have reached a minimum number of points and a minimum success rate, you will also receive symbolic awards such as flower pot, medal, and cup.\r\n•Online mode\r\n In this mode, up to 4 owners of a full license can play together online. If less then 4 users are participating in an online session, the remaining players are simulated. In parallel to the playing session, a Skype audio conference should be held, enabling the same conversation between the players as in a real card playing group. Before starting the first session, one of the online users must create a online user group. This user becomes the group administrator, responsible for maintaining the group. The lifespan of the group is limited to 90 days initially. By purchasing an add-on, the lifespan can be extended by 365 days per purchase. Online games are subject to charge. The full license already includes 25 payed online games. By purchasing an add-on, the contingent of payed online games can be increased by 100 or 500 games per purchase respectively.\r\n•Autonomous mode\r\n In this mode, the application plays completely independently without user participation. Of course, this is primarily intended for testing. But it can also be fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe user interface shows a gaming table in the middle where the players can place their cards. On the four sides of the table, the four players are located showing the hand cards, the tricks pile and other details. Only the hand cards of the user-controlled players are shown face-up. All other hands are showing the cards facedown. You - the current Windows user, must control at least one player.\r\n\r\nIn an offline session, you can undo and redo all actions of the game. You may also utilize assistance from \"Tarobot\" while playing. For replaying games, you can allocate a game archive. The archived games can be reopened and automatically replayed to any situation of interest. Experts may even build their very own games based on an existing game by using the edit mode. In this mode, cards can be exchanged freely between the players and between players and the Talon.\r\n\r\nIn an online session, you can play Tarock with your friends wherever they may be. Most of the manipulation and assistance functions of the offline mode are disabled in this case. Even though, the group administrator can enable and disable some them, such as \"undo\", with mutual consent even during a session.\r\n\r\nMultiple settings options allow you to change game parameters and appearance. You may select another color theme or another card face or card back design for example. You even may insert your favorite photo in one of the card backs containing a special photo frame. You can also activate speech output. Then, for example, you will hear the announcements of the simulated players and you do not have to pay so much attention to the screen display.\r\n\r\nIn the comprehensive online-help, you can find a detailed description of the game rules and of the user interface. It also describes how to perform each of the playing tasks.\r\n\r\nKubiTarock is designed for the Universal Windows Platform. You can install and use the app on all devices powered by Windows 10. The user interface adapts itself to the current device capabilities.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMC82","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"花札@GAMEPACK","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27354.9007199266440001.29873f52-40d1-4715-9d0d-38107572b3fe.d669cd51-6ffa-4666-b00b-96bc26257b6d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41191.9007199266440001.7d842838-3913-41aa-9c97-09d8db9890b1.3572790d-18c5-4699-8e55-a0b1ba4eae58","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["C00078DB.518278175E6F9_tyjbjaxc4qgce"],"ContentIds":["3625ac6f-28a6-15d5-02c3-88c39e8523cc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"☆Sale Information☆\r\nHaving a sale now !\r\nTake advantage of our special offer !!\r\n-------------------------------\r\nHanafuda is a Japanese traditional card game! \r\n\"Koi-Koi\" is the most popular game of Hanafuda. \r\nDo you choose \"Koi-Koi\" or choose \"Sho-bu\"?\r\nLet's enjoy tactics!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMHT1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jane's Zoo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27496.9007199266452308.06e9dae3-6857-408f-ad3e-597423f8bb50.d59a6565-6c8e-4adb-8ada-b675c493d955","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65484.9007199266452308.0d401cee-68ec-46b6-9396-78ef9d3831a1.71560c7d-9744-40e3-8d51-ffd5f8309eb7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$3.49","Price":3.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["780F5C7B.JanesZoo_0gmyx1dmsk3dw"],"ContentIds":["2180952f-8e65-9c2a-26e6-d483646f8cf4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Feel the spirit of freedom and plunge yourself into the world of wild nature!

Laura and Tim go to ski resort hoping to distract Laura from heavy thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere, on the edge of the world, misfortune befalls her. Tim goes out of the house in a fit of lunacy and falls off the cliff. He did not die, but is in a coma. It is not hard to guess that the fall off the cliff and coma are caused by intrigues of the Sandman.\r\n\r\nIt would seem what might be easier for Laura, having the absolute Power, to awaken her husband? However, being received the Power, Laura has made a commitment not to use the Power for her own benefit. This means that she can’t help Tim to wake up. And she has 2 choices: watch how her beloved slowly dies in the hospital, or have recourse to the help of an old friend again who once helped her when she was in a coma.\r\n\r\nWhen Laura met an old friend (the player), she stops the time to pass by the doctors unchecked and infiltrate in Tim’s ward, and then she immerses the player into the subconscious of Tim, whose body is almost seized by the Sandman.\r\n\r\nThe Sandman operates under the old scheme: by sending nightmares, he suppresses the will of the victim to resist.\r\nWill the player have time to wake up Tim before the Sandman turns him into his heir?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MT94TGSP47C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hidden Object : Guest House Renovation","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1153.13816935652605346.2dcb53e1-c695-417e-82b0-ce904d263df1.47ff78e4-8c81-42b6-937e-ea431214be50","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11815.13816935652605346.2dcb53e1-c695-417e-82b0-ce904d263df1.63c7e039-a361-400d-a277-92b3e0a8f14e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1739.13816935652605346.2dcb53e1-c695-417e-82b0-ce904d263df1.3aa3a2ad-437e-42fb-9c51-9bb01194cc9d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31406.13816935652605346.2dcb53e1-c695-417e-82b0-ce904d263df1.f89520a1-8d50-40ad-9e37-19c6a00ef7cd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2654JieDongLLC.HiddenObjectGuestHouseRenovation_qy8nsd7yxg59e"],"ContentIds":["1094a729-acbb-8547-c3cc-a775fde502bd","f22fc8cb-ae21-9bf5-6e06-f820d5f53955"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"An addictive hidden object game about guest house renovation!\r\n\r\nFind and spot all given hidden objects!\r\n\r\nWhen relatives, especially sisters and brothers, don't see each other often, the desire to spend some time together becomes really big.

Unfortunately, these alternative universes contain spheres that wish to turn everything round, so it’s up to Lucas to save the world from these dangerous aliens: the Spheroids.\r\n\r\nThroughout Spheroids' 32 levels, you’ll encounter many different environments, with multiple hazards to avoid and enemies to destroy. Items such as the “Modified Drilling Hook” Otto lends Lucas will help you traverse the environment with ease, with many more to find throughout.\r\n\r\nIncludes Xbox Live.

Symptoms can include light-headedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, momentary loss of awareness, and loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.\r\nImmediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these\r\nsymptoms. Parents, watch for or ask children about these symptoms— children and teenagers are more likely to experience these seizures. The risk may be reduced by being farther from the screen; using a smaller screen; playing in a well-lit room, and not playing when drowsy or fatigued. If you or any relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before\r\nplaying.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH425W0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cool Canasta","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13410.13510798887893993.2d0042b6-ea95-4116-8578-a06405c68eaf.c042c568-0782-452c-a454-736cf47a3d3a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$3.99","Price":3.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["38236CardsFun.CoolCanasta_wvhqmvdkxmhhc"],"ContentIds":["fc6e4137-635a-20cf-8e44-00ad2c10bcdc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Classic Canasta is a cool game to play as well as being completely addictive and great fun to play.

An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND SCORES\r\nOur trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score. Complete the figures to your best ability, exercise, win all medals and gain experience to rise to this level. This will give the you best scores and you will reach the top of the leaderboard!\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES:\r\n- F/A-18 fighter jets and C-130 “Fat Albert” transport aircraft\r\n- Innovative formation flying and assisted guidance system \r\n- All official Blue Angels maneuvers, playable in all roles\r\n- All configurations: takeoff, diamond, delta, echelon, line abreast and soloist\r\n\r\n- Use Airshow Mode to complete a real exhibition with a custom sequence of maneuvers\r\n- Additive Mode to create your aerobatic figure\r\n- Special missions: free flight, exploratory, pursuit and C-130 JATO\r\n\r\n- 3D Briefing display for easy understanding of the maneuver\r\n- Innovative help system with three difficulty levels to suit both beginners and more experienced pilots\r\n- Accurate trajectory measurement system for evaluation of the score\r\n\r\n- 3D virtual cockpit\r\n- Multi-camera replay system with dynamic views\r\n- 3D exploratory area to deepen knowledge of the aircraft","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH557RV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Silence - The Whispered World 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7797.13510798887868631.c101637b-6f39-400a-b57f-3d17424e4b69.59335f56-ed9f-41e0-896f-a598ac4707aa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25365.13510798887868631.f3561128-a1ef-40cf-8611-e9f68e16d318.000f38e1-1ab8-46a2-af59-c6c4f4a3d584","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34473.13510798887868631.5832d952-c9a0-439d-955f-f3d07c53965f.9b6e2062-2a38-4b2a-b68f-01448891f9c7","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45346.13510798887868631.ce783d58-d3d1-4f34-8234-3b52417c7980.7a0e3f2d-86ad-4167-b203-e2fb102aadab","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11486.13510798887868631.5d3c4525-3364-449d-a129-7befe4af746e.a59ac6bf-73db-49e9-b9ce-4629a04ceba4","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"USD$29.99","DisplayPrice":"USD$20.09","Price":20.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","SubscriptionDiscountMessageTemplate":"with {0}","PackageFamilyNames":["DaedalicEntertainment.188032111D123_9w6n57xt7hhbc"],"ContentIds":["098d8736-20fa-85a2-5292-d0b993917b4e","e34b57c3-fca1-ed05-0cca-42c19e5bf31b","660044a2-96d1-4a85-8c55-fc9d0138cac0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"PlaintextPassName":"Gold","GlyphTextPassName":"StoreGlyphXboxGoldInline","AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"War rages on.
