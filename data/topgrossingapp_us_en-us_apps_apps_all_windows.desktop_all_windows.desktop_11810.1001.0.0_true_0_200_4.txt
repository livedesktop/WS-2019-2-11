For various credit cards, online-banking, security-token, email accounts and so on? \r\n\r\niPIN - and your PINs and passwords are always at hand. \r\n\r\nYour professional password manager on the go and at home: access at lightning speed, as secure as possible and also in sync via WiFi Sync at any time with your Android, Windows, Mac and iOS devices. \r\n\r\nThe highlight: login with the sensor keyboard \r\n\r\nWith an innovative sensor keyboard you'll have quick access to all your PINs - without any annoying and time-killing passwords. Just remember a geometrical shape, a digit, an alphabetic character or an individual sensor combination and set up your private sensor code. \r\n\r\nYou can simply touch a sensor or swipe across multiple sensors at once. Naturally, combinations are allowed and should be used to make your sensor code as secure as possible. The first touch activates the sensor, and with a second touch the sensor becomes deactivated. You can activate and deactivate the sensors as often as you like. Your individual sensor code is calculated by the order in which you have activated and deactivated the sensors and in which way the sensors have been activated and deactivated: single touch or swipe. \r\n\r\nSecurity \r\n\r\nSecurity is of greatest importance! All data (including the data in iCloud if you enable iCloud synchronisation in iPIN) is encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard and a key length of 256 bit (abbreviated AES-256).

is the best app if you want to keep track of every stats of the players of your team while attending a game live. All you need is a laptop, know your players well and be comfortable with your keyboard.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this app is that it uses keyboard shortcuts to save every kind of play.\r\nThus, it might seem a bit difficult to use at first,  but once you will be familiar with the app, the purpose of the keys and how it's operating overall, you'll be able to track a game with accuracy, almost like the pros, but just by yourself.\r\nThat's why there is a free trial of 30 days, so you can spend enough time trying the app in real situations before purchasing it.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this app to track stats of players of both teams, but it will be a little more tricky to use, simply because it's hard for one person to watch everything happening. But it's technically possible.\r\n\r\nOne interesting feature of this app is that it can also track where the shots are made and attempted. But you will need a keyboard with the numeric keypad on its right for this feature to work.\r\n\r\nBesides full court 5 against 5 games, the app can be set for games of 3 vs 3 and 4 vs 4.\r\n\r\nAfter a game, the data of the stats can be exported to an Excel file, which will be properly formatted and containing sheets about the box score, advanced stats, clutch time stats, box score by lineups, play-by-play for teams and for each player, and a scoring chart.\r\n\r\nThe images of the shots spots are also saved for every player, for the complete teams, and for the starters and bench players.\r\n\r\nThis app is not made for tablets or touch screen devices.\r\n\r\nOnce downloaded, the app can work without any internet access.\r\n\r\nThis app can be used in 4 languages: english, french, spanish and portuguese.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZ1PW8","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Oxford Paravia Italian Dictionary","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64666.13510798883824745.9c2722e1-01d8-487c-850e-9feeb05b7234.390abfe0-4ace-4998-958b-9c327833c080","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14035.13510798883824745.d22e9643-14fe-4220-9672-5553b9604030.6a158d43-4cb3-4867-8b56-bc49ffb7f1ee","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13690.13510798883824745.b3b62f41-36f2-47d4-803f-421e16039c72.e5c66642-e854-413b-9167-22e2c90761b0","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$19.99","Price":19.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["MobiSystems.OxfordParaviaItalianDictionary_8m57vzdwnbybp"],"ContentIds":["31f245db-12a9-da3a-3f3b-a3dcd62448a8","f5ed2a46-00b3-db6d-0b59-38778b8fa1d6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Oxford-Paravia Italian Dictionary is the most complete and up-to-date Italian dictionary available.

It is a scientifically-based, easy to use app that you can use to help children and adults of all ages learn to read and spell. \r\n\r\nCreated by reading specialist and speech-language pathologist Dr. Bartek Rajkowski, PhD, Word Builder™ is a fun and intuitive means through which to learn how to use letter-sound patterns to crack the code in the English language. It is designed to be used in parallel with any synthetic phonics program (such as Jolly Phonics or MULTILIT).\r\n\r\nWord Builder™ is perfect for teaching beginning readers, students with reading difficulties and students learning English as a second language. We are confident that the program will quickly become a favourite tool for anybody with an interest in the teaching of reading and spelling! While the app is designed to be able to be used independently, it is a perfect complement to our other apps.\r\n\r\nWHICH SKILLS DOES WORD BUILDER™ HELP WITH?\r\n \r\nTry reading this word: hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia. How did you read it? Research suggests that we read unfamiliar words by converting letter patterns to speech sounds and then mentally joining the sounds to read the word. Competent readers self-teach by successfully decoding new words, while poor letter-sound knowledge and decoding ability are hallmarks of reading difficulties. This code-cracking skill has been shown through decades of research to be crucial in learning to read and spell. Word Builder™ helps students learn the following code-cracking skills found through research to be vital in learning to read and write in English: \r\n\r\nGRAPHEME KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nRemembering letter-sound relationships. For example, the letter pattern “ay” represents the sound /ay/, like in “play”. \r\n\r\nSEGMENTATION \r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to break words up into individual speech sounds. For example, the word “cat” consists of the sounds /k/, /ae/ and /t/. \r\n\r\nBLENDING\r\n\r\nBeing able to join individual speech sounds together to make words. For example, joining the speech sounds /s/.../p/.../oo/.../n/ makes the word /spoon/.\r\n\r\nDECODING\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to read unfamiliar words by using letter-sound relationships. For example, if a student did not recognise the word “flight” when reading, they could say the speech sounds represented by the letter-sound patterns (/f/../l/../igh/../t/) and mentally join the speech sounds to read the word.\r\n\r\nENCODING\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to spell unfamiliar words by using letter-sound relationships. For example, if a student did not know how to spell the word /play/, they could break the word up into separate speech sounds and spell the word based on letter-sound patterns (“p..l..ay”). \r\n\r\nREADING AND SPELLING IRREGULAR (TRICKY) WORDS\r\n\r\nAbout 15% of words in English contain unusual or uncommon letter-sound relationships. Many of these words are 'sight words', meaning that they occur frequently in the language. Research suggests that students need to be taught these irregular words explicitly.\r\n\r\nWHICH LETTER-SOUND PATTERNS ARE INCLUDED?\r\n\r\nWord Builder™ includes letter-sound tiles, adjustable visual mnemonics (memory aids), studio-quality sound recordings and animations of mouth movements for the following core letter-sound patterns in English:\r\n\r\n29 Single letter-sounds + \"silent / bossy e\", for example:\r\n\r\n\"a\" like in \"apple\"\r\n\"p\" like in \"pan\"\r\n\"o\" like in \"open\"\r\n\r\n24 vowel letter-sound patterns consisting of 2 or more letters, for example:\r\n\r\n\"igh\" like in \"light\"\r\n\"ee\" like in \"see\"\r\n\"oo\" like in \"spoon\"\r\n\r\n15 consonant letter-sound patterns consisting of 2 or more letters, for example:\r\n\r\n\"sh\" like in \"ship\"\r\n\"th\" like in \"mouth\"\r\n\"dge\" like in \"bridge\"\r\n\r\n14 \"r-controlled\" letter-sound patterns consisting of 2 or more letters, for example:\r\n\r\n\"er\" like in \"her\"\r\n\"ar\" like in \"car\"\r\n\"ore\" like in \"shore\"\r\n\r\n9 word endings, for example:\r\n\r\n\"ing\" like in \"wing\"\r\n\"le\" like in \"little\"\r\n\"ous\" like in \"famous\"\r\n\r\nHOW DO STUDENTS USE WORD BUILDER™ ? \r\n\r\nWord Builder™ gives students an easy way to experiment with making and reading words using the most common letter-sound patterns in English. Students tap on letter-sound patterns to hear the speech sounds they represent. Students can make words by combining these patterns. The student moves his or her finger over the patterns in a word to hear the individual speech sounds in the word and see the letter patterns that represent those speech sounds. An animation of a mouth explicitly teaches students about the relationship between speech and written language while strengthening articulatory awareness skills. Letter-sound patterns can be moved and replaced by dragging and dropping them. They can also be deleted. Students can check to see if words they have made are correctly spelled. \r\n\r\nHOW DO PARENTS, TEACHERS AND READING SPECIALISTS USE WORD BUILDER™ TO HELP STUDENTS? \r\n\r\nYou can use Word Builder™ to build words with letter-sound tiles for the student to read, or you can say a word for the student to build. You can change the selection of letter-sound tiles used in activities so that beginning students can practice with the most basic building blocks of written language while more advanced readers can learn less common patterns. You can also save letter-sound tile sets for later use. An in-built memory-aid system helps students to remember letter-sound relationships. Once students begin to remember these relationships, the memory-aid system may be turned off so that students can begin to remember letter-sound patterns by themselves. \r\n\r\nPlease read our guide to using Word Builder for more information on using the app:\r\nhttp://www.readingdoctor.com.au/word-builder-how-to-use/\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\n\r\nAlthough students enjoy using WordBuilder™, it is a serious teaching tool, not a game!

Japanese Intermediate will take your Japanese language skills to the next level. If you liked the first HJ, you'll love Intermediate. (And if you're new to Human Japanese, welcome aboard! Find a full list of content by chapter at www.humanjapanese.com/intermediate.)\r\n\r\nLike its predecessor, Human Japanese Intermediate is built on the idea that the best way to learn and truly comprehend Japanese is to have it explained by someone who speaks your language. Core concepts are explained in a friendly, down-to-earth tone, with frequent comparisons to similar aspects of English. With humor and warmth, it demystifies and illuminates the real nuts-and-bolts of the language--not just vocabulary and canned phrases like many other products.\r\n\r\nExplanations come alive with deeply interwoven interactive example sentences--more than 2600 in total--so that you can immediately see and hear exactly what you're learning.\r\n\r\nStay on track with INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns. Next to every sentence is an icon that provides an instantaneous, simultaneous lookup of every word in the sentence, even conjugated forms! That means you'll never lose your flow in the middle of an interesting discussion just because you've momentarily forgotten the meaning of a word.\r\n\r\nSolve the chicken-and-egg aspect of kanji with our integrated approach that carefully explains how everything works and then dynamically changes the \"spellings\" of words to either kana, kanji, or kanji with furigana to match what you've learned at that point.\r\n\r\nStay sharp with five different kinds of quizzes that track your history to help you focus on trouble spots.\r\n\r\nWe care deeply about helping you to grow in your understanding of Japanese. Whether you've worked through the original Human Japanese app or have come from a different background, it will be our pleasure and privilege to be your guide on the next stage of your journey.

Together with the WYSIWYG designer, this powerful app allows you to create stunningly beautiful scrapbook pages and photo prints quickly and creatively.  \r\n\r\nMost of the scrapbook templates or photo layouts in the app are available in A4 and Letter size. This makes the app uniquely different from other apps as it enables you to print your layout easily on desktop printers. The templates automatically spice up the blank space around the photos containing your beautiful memories and creations on common paper size. Besides A4 and Letter size, the app is also equipped with a Page customization wizard to allow you to specify 3R, 4R, 12in x 12in and other desired sizes. \r\n\r\nOn a last note, we definitely have fun developing the app and we hope you enjoy using it too.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1RJJ7","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"WiFi Monitor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.28931.13510798886171640.699a1ccb-fb89-4078-bbc1-4bc25f450831.12b80378-efd2-4763-9e8a-e05b64c2343e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.27201.13510798886171640.7733ef9e-b997-43dc-9b39-dc01e8022c1e.c03c549e-89eb-408f-a09d-a3aa06b2d00f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.27615.13510798886171640.1638d2a9-c626-4d30-935c-edb1846f78d2.6e31900d-fb20-44ce-a363-a3b672dbc89d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.45741.13510798886171640.9834b170-93cd-4ffb-a40e-b32c40733811.3c028514-f3f0-496f-9f40-224107480554","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10030.13510798886171640.92608696-22f9-4820-9d27-a256186ea1b6.43a3ae44-40f4-4498-bce0-e6cf25ab52f7","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"153","PackageFamilyNames":["56154LaikaGlove.WiFiMonitor_yfs9q3kpgqxv8"],"ContentIds":["0de8266d-3e23-8d7a-6faa-4804a23eee87"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Analyze nearby WiFi hotspots to find the best channel for your network!\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to view nearby WiFi networks in order to determine the most suitable settings for your own network.

It covers the same topics as the award winning game DragonBox Algebra 5+, but moves on to cover more advanced topics in mathematics and algebra. It also includes practice tasks that allow students to practice specific types of algebraic operations.\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra 12+ covers the following algebraic concepts:\r\n\r\n* Addition\r\n* Division\r\n* Multiplication\r\n* Parentheses\r\n* Positive and Negative signs\r\n* Addition of Fractions (Common Denominators)\r\n* Collection of Like Terms\r\n* Factorization\r\n* Substitution\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra 12+ is suitable for more advanced students than DragonBox 5+, as it covers curriculum from late primary to early high school. \r\n\r\nDragonBox uses a novel pedagogical method based on discovery and experimentation. Players learn how to solve equations in a playful and colorful game environment where they are encouraged to experiment and be creative. By manipulating cards and trying to isolate the DragonBox on one side of the game board, the player gradually learns the operations required to isolate X on one side of an equation. Little by little, the cards are replaced with numbers and variables, revealing the operators the player has been learning throughout the game. \r\n\r\nPlaying does not require supervision, although parents can assist them in transferring learned skills into pen and paper equation solving. It is a great game for parents to play with their kids and can even give them an opportunity to freshen up their own math skills.\r\n\r\nDragonBox was developed by former math teacher Jean-Baptiste Huyhn and has been heralded as a perfect example of game-based learning. As a result, it is currently forming the basis of an extensive research project by the Center For Game Science at the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra has received many distinctions including the Gold Medal of the 2012 Serious Play Award (USA), the Best Serious game at Bilbao´s Fun and Serious Game Festival and the Best Serious Game at the 2013 International Mobile Gaming Awards. It is also recommended by Common Sense Media where it won the Learn ON award.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n* 10 progressive chapters\r\n* 10 practice chapters\r\n* 357 puzzles \r\n* Basic algebraic rules with which the child can experiment\r\n* A focus on minimal instruction encourages creativity and experimentation from the player \r\n* Multiple profiles for easy progress control \r\n* Dedicated graphics and music for each chapter \r\n* Multiple supported languages: English, français, norsk, svenska, dansk, español, 한국어, italiano, português, Deutsch, русский, 简体中文, 繁體中文, suomi, Nederlands, Eesti, Euskara, Türkçe, Čeština, Lietuvių, Magyar, 日本語...\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\n\r\nGold Medal\r\n2013 International Serious Play Awards","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDK44M","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"My Movies for Windows 8","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23009.9007199266520916.bffb9136-2a10-4a3e-ba0d-e8b5f9dbede4.bd2c195f-b748-4545-8fd8-58c40579dcba","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23536.9007199266520916.0cd2b77e-8e07-4dd0-8f9f-87dc821490ca.a67a22ed-a9ed-4af9-91bd-0d5a18d59e1a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$7.99","Price":7.99,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"71","PackageFamilyNames":["BinnerupConsultvBrianBinn.MyMoviesforWindowsPhone_r6wr8wbefgmhp"],"ContentIds":["0b8aa746-e547-1b7f-31f3-d550cc7a1da1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Notice!

Encryption Standard (AES).  Data is stored independent of application and will not be deleted if application is uninstalled.  Decrypted data is accessible by any application installed on device.\r\n\r\nApplication provides two methods to encrypt and decrypt data.  Each method has advantages and disadvantages.  Choose which method to use depending on data size and intended use.\r\n\r\nFirst method places folder or file into an archive file and then encrypts archive file.  Files in folder cannot be seen since they were placed into one file.  Sharing content is simple since only one file needs to be exchanged.  Limitation of this method is it creates one large file to encrypt.  This method will exceed device memory limits more often than second method since encrypting one large file versus many smaller files.  This method is always slower than second method.\r\n\r\nSecond method encrypts individual files located in hierarchy of AES folder.  This method is always faster than first method since folders are not archived into one file.    Folders of any size can be encrypted.  File will not be encrypted if it exceeds device limit discussed above.  Application will show list of files not encrypted.  Limitation of this method is files in a folder are visible.  This limitation can be minimized by using generic folder and file names such as Folder01 and File01.
